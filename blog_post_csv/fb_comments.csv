MÃ©lenchon, however, does not want to leave the EU but wants to renegotiate with the other countries to improve it for the people (for now, it really only benefits the rich and the banks). We love Europe, that's why we want to change it. 
Macron stands in the the political line that we have for 30 years now, that also only benefits the rich, so we want to change for something more human and efficient for the greater good. Even from an economic point of view, it's now unsunstainable, and it will certainly not ""boost the economy"", on the contrary.
We will see what will happen on Sunday; but it's the inhumanity of the liberal policies that we had for the last decades that put many in misery, and those people now wants to vote for the FN. So I hope we will not make this mistake, nor the same that we made in the several precedent elections, that is perpetuate a system which is not based on the human, the respect of nature, and the search for hapiness above the compulsive need of money.
In fact (and to simplify, obvioulsy),, it's comparable with what you Americans had with Sanders, Clinton and Trump, but here it's MÃ©lenchon, Macron et Le Pen.
I'm sorry if I made some mistakes and I hope I've been clear enough :) much love from France !","1189181954544145_1189224601206547",2017-04-17

Saying that MÃ©lenchon is an extreme and lame haha. Ignoring most small candidates. 10 minutes dedicated to beg ppl not to vote le Pen just like you did for trump. And did it even work?... Putting Macron as a favorite, when he gathers 20000 people in Paris and call it a success. Ignoring the fact that he controls the media and polls just cause he has money (surprising for someone like you who cares about telling the truth and is usually denouncing propaganda). Ignoring that he had no program a few weeks ago and is still unclear about a few parts. He just agrees with anything Brussels says. 

Keep on ignoring that MÃ©lenchon gathers 130000 at Bastille Paris. 70000 in Marseille. Recently 25000 in Lille. And today thousands more. 

We, French people, will vote for peace. 
MÃ©lenchon is absolutely not anti EU. 
He s actually PRO EU cause we all love our different countries and cultures but we MUST respect the fact that we re different economically. Hence we shouldn't ask Greece to pay astronomical amounts of money. We ll ask Germany and Brussels to stop making all countries poorer and stop giving private banks huge sums of money leading to our loss. And they're gonna listen to us cause they're nothing without France (we're the ones providing them most funds). You understand that could only work if we're saying we're leaving the EU right? We only want to have an economy that is more respectful of the environment and of social rights for workers. 
We must stop the excessive travel of products around the world. It is not sustainable and is horrible for our world and for the people. We don't want of your disgusting med fed meat and GMO food. 
Thank Obama (Nobel prize for peace let me laugh at that a few minutes) for agreeing with stupid Hollande on putting missiles in Poland. Now we've increased tensions with Russia and truly are facing a war because of your stupid decision (keep on wasting so much money of your country for controlling wars in the world and do not care about your own people facing financial and health troubles). Peace only comes with diplomatic and stable relationships, and we understand that. No more bombs in Syria. No more weird agreements and financing with Saudi Arabia. Keep on killing innocents including your own people in the world America, you're great at that. 

 MÃ©lenchon is the only to truly understand the urgency we face with climate change and offers a truly solid and economically thought program to help transitioning to sustainability and green energy. No more nuclear. No more stealing Africa s uranium just for profit and making them poorer. 

You didn't talk about his innovative plan to change our republic. A chance given for our people to be truly involved in politics. We're going to fight corruption and we're going to find all the big companies (apple google McDonald's and even our own ones) flying away from taxes in France when they make such huge profit here. Thank some of your states for giving us that idea. But No more capitalistic sovereignty, sorry for you. 

I hope you'll all call us communists when MÃ©lanchon wins, Oliver. 
Be ready to get surprised when he wins. We made our Revolution and we won. It's way time for a new one. 
Stay stuck in your stupid Cold War years world. 
Meh, I guess it's unavoidable when all you did was calling to vote for Hillary. Sanders made the mistake to fight against a highly corrupted woman. And your people weren't stupid enough to lead her to a victory. Now all you do is whining but don't you realise YOU'RE the cause of this? If you had given Bernie a chance, talking about his awesome program for justice, he would have won against trump. 
Please understand that people voting for le Pen are either completely racist but also really lost. Just like the ones who voted for trump. They're just asking for jobs and a slightly better income to survive. Better working conditions. Not the reducing of teacher and nurses number that macron is asking for. 

MÃ©lenchon cares about true equality btw women and men. He cares about animal mistreatment. He cares about all lives. We're humanists. Call us dreamers. We want a world that is truly peaceful and brotherly, not just calling for it. And we're gonna get it. ;)

You are just a ""radical shock"" who support the ""modern jihad"", ignorant of history and unable to read numbers, statistics and trends...

I hope Le Pen wins the FR elections!! 
Today, not only in France, the Islamic are taking slowly the control, by threatening others, blackmailing with pity, playing with the good intentions of a few Lefty. Islamic try to put local French against each other.

Why is so hard to accept that not all people wants to live in a Globalized economy, or multicultural or multi-ethnic Society??? specially when minorities (specially islamics) wants to take only benefits, or claim rights they never had, or just come to take advantage of the Social System. Btw a system created by our ancestors for Local people, money accumulated on 80 years, not for ""just arrived"" migrants. 

Not everybody stays calm or accept when Islamics came to EU, try to impose their rules, not respect our Christian traditions, disrespect local women, harass gays or young West girls.. or just came as a ""modern Jihad"". EU was created by Romans as Christian land, and West values are based on that, our Flags have cross every where.. sometimes our kindness and patient are taken as weakness, or our sensitivity and humanity are taken as stupidity.. Luckily are still patriots today. Remember that only 50 years ago the number of Islamics was 0.1% in EU today is almost 10% and some cities is already 20-30%.

Lefty people should start tu accept that not everybody think as they think... that the country where they live doesn't belong only to them, but to all and by democracy we all have a right of an opinion, even if this one is different or far from Lefty wing. 

Lefty today are a bunch of irresponsible Anarchist, ""radical shick"", who live out the reality, care more about ""showing off"" than resolve problems, take decisions based on feelings and sympathy than reading numbers... no way people will trust in Lefty wing again!","1189181954544145_1286128138103837",2017-04-29

The regions that amount to 90% of Turkish GDP voted NO to their constitutional reform. The uneducated and unproductive masses, as well as their parasite welfare-leeching counterparts in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, voted 'YES'. So tell me again what makes majority-voting the superior alternative? If you want to do majority-voting, you'd have to make it conditional. John Oliver used ""taxation but no representation"" for himself being a migrant in the US. I think it should be ""only representation if taxation"". With that condition, you'd have a case to argue for majority-voting. Without it, tell me again why it's beneficial in the case of Turkey?","1189181954544145_674894866031446",2017-04-18

I do understand progressives need to help out less fortunate people around the world. But the truth is when you take from people who have very little and who think and rightfully so that they live on marginal economic financial footing. And give it to people who have nothingâ€¦ and vastly keep the economic riches that are held by the wealthy and the elite groupings a monks the richâ€¦ there will be blowback by the middle class and working poorâ€¦ 

In the United States when you call people who are the ones who vote the most deplorable's stupid racesâ€¦ you usually don't do well in the electionsâ€¦ 

I've also noticed the trends of progressives trying their best. To come up with reasons why they lost the election other then the real reasonâ€¦ whites are racistâ€¦ the Russians hacked our electionâ€¦. The electoral college is flawedâ€¦ but with all these excuses the truth is you loss the firewallâ€¦ democrats lost the Rust Beltâ€¦ and the collation of diversity stayed homeâ€¦ if you look at Pennsylvania this is what happenedâ€¦ and you see it and every other state that the Democrats used to be able to count onâ€¦ the firewall failed

But itâ€™a good thingâ€¦ because Democrats are now forced to actually compete in all 50 states.
And in reestablish the power of the union over the individual which many individuals on the left and progressives in particular were forgetting about the United Statesâ€¦ they all forgot that we do not live in the country called the united individuals of Americaâ€¦ we in fact live in a country called the United States of America..,. And this past election proved it once againâ€¦ 

now if the French has to have an election like this to facilitate brutal honesty and reality with Progressives then so be it, progressives you have to understand just like social conservatives learned you cannot dictate a person's personal attitude towards another. Social engineering of this type never worksâ€¦ there is always a pushback or a system that pushes back against it and unfortunately for progressives it is capitalism that is pushing back on the progress of narrative and the progressive worldview. 

In a sense you can think of it like this the progressive worldview went up against the American dreamâ€¦ and the American dream win and the progressives half to learn thisâ€¦","1189181954544145_1189413011187706",2017-04-17

Well, I see a LOT of anti Macron popping up here and there, and no anti Le Pen. It seems that people who voted for Melanchon will at best not vote or vote ""white"", but not for Macron. I read testimonies of friends telling that their socialist families were going to vote Le Pen. Sounds strangely familiar doesn't it? Macron is seen by many as a product of a long political tradition, + former banker; the people does not identify with the guy and do not trust him for shaking things up and take care of the real concerns.

Take 50% of your earning from this point forth, forever, to the same cause, paying down the debt. Take your remaining income and give half that to the homeless charities and veterans charities.

Take Iron Fist, as an example. There was a huge push to make him asian, ignoring the fact that Danny's whiteness juxtaposed to Luke Cage's blackness is one of the reasons for the odd couple success of the Heroes for Hire. 

Not to say that diversity shouldn't happen ever. If changing the race doesn't change core elements/attributes of the character and his interactions, thats fine. Making Ben Grimm black is fine. Making Susan Storm Richards white while Johnny Storm is black...not so much, particularly since the Storm's being biologically connected is actually important.

Creators purposefully designed Kusanagi without any racial features because having no specified race contributes to the limitations on her personal identity. Director of the anime Mamoru Oshii has expressly approved of Johansson's casting, and stated she was doing a fantastic job of capturing the role while filming was ongoing. The show's complete ignorance of the facts in this case undermines the credibility of their opinion, and ironically neglects what partially makes the show as respected and revered as it is - research.","1169225136539827_1169459026516438",2017-03-31

"330","Whitewashing","XebG4TO_xss","479042895558058_1169225136539827","One of my roommates just made an interesting point he doesn't think trump isn't just not as rich as he is, he thinks he's broke. Hear me out logically first I think he might be completely right or that trump is close to broke only having a few million he says that he's broke though. Let's think about it trump owns currently 33 properties leased to him in the USA according to Forbes. That more than half have outstanding debt of which the most is the manhattan property with 157 million in debt. Let's think about this now barely people would stay at some of his hotels and now no one does. But let's go deeper in 2005 he only made roughly 150 million. That's no where near enough to run 30 properties much less 15. Now let's factor in because how strapped for cash he was he jumped into putting his name on everything and into the housing market which also failed. He runs out of money to fund his projects after he builds them slightly with loans most likely declares bankruptcy gets the money back. But the loan part that's something else entirely won't get into that. My point is he operates in the red as stated as he told his daughter ""see that guy, that guy has more money than me"" referring to a homeless man. See to most he made 150 million that's more than I will ever make, yeah but it doesn't matter when he spends his money worse than you. Back to the main point you know why he really has melania staying in trump tower? It's not because she wants to divorce him which she probably does but because it's paying him money that he's already losing. Money he was naturally losing before he was a bigeot and people stopped going to his places, that are now more Barron than before. He goes to places he owns so much because it's tax payer money he can directly funnel to himself. It's the prefect panzi scheme for someone who's a con artist as it is. And while you're saying tax payers shouldn't have to pay for it you're forgetting you're paying him to do it. None of the media has mentioned that aspect that trump is paying himself everyday more than he would make normally off his property. His tax returns if you were smart would tell you he's broke, not that he isn't as rich as he was. His income of you would look at it would show you there's no way he's able to do the things he does unless someone else is giving him money. After all he's more of a figure piece then an actual player. He put on a show while you are distracted from the truth. He's using tax prayer money to bail out his properties because he's broke. It's why he takes so many trips, it's why he's kids do and it's why his wife stays in New York. I would go into how Russia plays into this but... I think it's pretty obvious... Money has to come from somewhere.

As a disguise a Bolivian minister said that 7 out 10 bolivians uses coca, we are a population of 11 million people, 7.823.800 people are over 15 years old, we will have to assume everyone of them uses coca so that what Minister Romero said is even close to real.

The situations are fairly different, mind you; the CHL's straight up a for-profit company with no pretensions about being a learning institution, and unlike the NCAA which uses high school graduated college students, the CHL uses players aged 16-20, with a majority of players being 17-18, still in high school. So as you can see, it's a bit more of a grey area than the NCAA situation.

Just because a person is big and strong doesn't mean they're employable. Turn these competitive college teams into clubs or make it a major that the students pay for (if they don't academically meet the standards for a scholarship) and allow them to get paid for any work outside of their schooling.  Somebody might say this makes recruiting a nightmare and they'd be right.  It levels the playing field and forces colleges to focus on bettering the education they provide and their career placement statistics to all students fairly not just the big strong students (whom they're not education anyway).","1154182574710750_1154252534703754",2017-03-15

(Itâ€™s all about ratingsâ€¦Colbert, Noah, Oliverâ€¦that donâ€™t care about you, and you all fall for it..BRING BACK JOHNNY CARSON RERUNS)
Late-night funnyman David Letterman was hardly a barrel of laughs off the air.
A new biography of the now-retired talk show host portrays Letterman as more self-loathing than self-critical â€” and an often miserable man who inflicted his pain on his staff.

So when I had 4 yrs. 10 months in as and RN at a hospital, the hospital administration dropped their pension plan for anyone with less that 5 years employment....so goodby pension and goodby being able to buy into the group health insurance. So I worked for many years, bought a home and improved it with the plan of selling it to downsize for retirement and to be able to help my adult kids get started with a nest egg.  I also worked full time nights, at least every other week end and most holidays.  I also had a 403 account (like a 401 but for a nonprofit) paid into for years. Then I was due to retire in 2009. But Bush broke the economy...I lost all of the equity in my home (over $200,000) and ended up paying $6000 to be clear of the mortgage when I sold it in the spring of 2010. My retirement account dropped to less than half. I was able to continue working til the spring or 2010 and it recovered a little, but not a whole lot.  I had to transfer the money from the 403 into an IRA annuity plan at my credit union.  They only showed one option (this is a very bad sign because this is the one that is not best for you but gives them the biggest bonus. I wish I knew that then..)  Even though the stock market was improving,  my retirement funds never increased by more than $200 a year and often lost much more than that. I never thought I'd rely on social security because I worked hard, owned a home with a lot of equity and had a nice retirement account (all of which were destroyed by the actions of republican presidents and the gop in congress).  Now, my maid source of income is social security.  All of the work, saving and trying to invest well all was in vain because of the greed of wall street and their complicent president and congressional buddies.","1116422285153446_1116441061818235",2017-02-03

What sodium pentothal and its analogs do is turn off your critical processes, the filters and connections that allow you to form coherent thoughts. It causes 'stream of consciousness' speech - one thought triggers another weird (and often unconnected) thought and all are expressed aloud. You can be lead, by a skillful interrogator, to say just about anything unless, just before it takes hold, something catches your attention or fancy. I am pretty sure that the rambling I did during my lumpectomy, which my surgeon commented on but refused to detail under 'patient/ doctor confidentiality', was about the relative sexiness of his eyes v the female anesthetist's and the relevance of foot size to, um the size of the third leg (the doctor took, maybe, a size seven shoe and had excellent taste in men's footwear.) He was a pocket-sized cutie and the fact that eighteen years later I still remember this tells me that my guess is probably pretty accurate. That and the fact that my last conscious comment was to compare their eyes. His family is locally renowned for the blue of their eyes. There have been reports of interrogations resulting in an hour of discourse on a child's upcoming birthday party, a list of mundane errands and the subject's opinions on a host of sites he would pass or persons he would meet while collecting his laundry, picking up staples, dropping off a report, getting some magazines...you get the drift. Even the one from the CIA training film above often backfires as building the dependent relationship can often lead the interrogator to share information with the subject that is detrimental to the interrogator. Actual torture usually results in the subject saying whatever s/he believes will stop the torture and they come up with some pretty complex and fanciful answers to that.","1107837516011923_1109256475870027",2017-01-27

""Based on what we know about the order, this is a dark day for our country. This action endangers the lives of Americans and will make us far less safe. It will divert resources away from fighting terrorism in order to crack down on our loved ones. It will feed xenophobia and turn Americans against one another.

 Pete Saenz is the mayor of Laredo, which sits on the Texas border with Mexico. The Mayor said ,Well, what we need is a virtual wall, frankly. You know, technology is so advanced nowadays.                                                          

   Technological Section-Fiber Optic Backbone Benefits & Security 

Along the same route and parallel to the water pipe will be installed a proposed 36 strand, armor encapsulated buried fiber optic cable. The communication solution is Ciscoâ€™s Enterprise Data Center Architecture along with other third party equipment. The equipment will be scalable in order to meet future and optional upgrade demands. Two major objectives outlined below encompass a concise description of the fiber optic backbone.

Primary Objective
The primary objective for this project consists of implementing state of the art technology to create complete access control over every mechanical device and sensor used to control the water distribution quality and network flow throughout its destination source and aquifer recharge process control.

This includes, but may not be limited to;

Inlet & Outlet Valves
Pump Actuator Control Units
Level controllers - are devices that operate automatically to regulate liquid or dry material level values.
Pressure Sensors
Liquid leak detectors - sense when a liquid is leaking from a pipe, tank, or other receptacle area.
Flow controllers - operate automatically to regulate flow direction and velocity.
Pressure process controllers - are devices that regulate either positive or negative vacuum pressure.
pH Controllers - monitor potential of hydrogen (pH) levels and initiate controller functions. They provide rapid on/off control of dosing and are used in applications such as food processing, hydroponics, water purification, and waste control.

The data will be monitored both by the network engineers to assure optimal network performance at all times, while the water control technicians will monitor the actual general water parameters that encompass quality and transfer stability. 

Secondary Objective
In general, voice, video, and data transmissions are the secondary usage of such a network. More specific applications or subcategories include a few of the following;

Hi speed, hi bandwidth internet service to ranchers,Oil & Gas lines , highway commuters, federal, state, county, and local law enforcement agencies, emergency personnel, and cities along the way. 
Telecommunication- Commuters have the ability to have a crisp and clear conversation using their laptop, Cisco softphone software, and a good headset. These calls are unlimited and a long distance conference can easily be held on the side of the road in a rest area or the passenger can initiated a call with a mouse click away.
Video transmission, 
On demand video and control of real time IP cameras for Border Patrol, DPS Troopers, FBI, DEA, County Law Enforcement and Amber Alert Program.
This application can be used as a powerful crime fighting & safety tool to monitor and apprehend drug traffickers, illegal aliens, hazardous cargo loads, wandering cattle and motor vehicle accidents along the highway.
Provide live classroom instructional feed from a central campus to remote classroom locations. Including the ability to become a cable network provider such as Time Warner. 
Cell Phone provider- This will eliminate the need to pay thousands of dollars to existing cell phone providers and assign Cisco mobile phones to local utility employees, police, ambulance, fire department, and other agencies. 
The amount of revenue generated from this cable immensely outweighs that of the intended necessity of water to the southwest regions. Furthermore, it can create a reasonable return on investment and provide expanded budgetary allowances that can enhance the overall well being of the community in general.
Cost not included in Secondary Water Source RFP with Laredo . This is an additional fiber technology option .

Due to voter registration requirements in place in every State, Voter Fraud is virtually non existent -- it is easily exposed, granular and impossible to implement at any significant scale, thus completely ineffectual. Election Fraud, on the other hand, is a fully institutionalized pandemic in this country, from the Party duopoly and delegate systems to gerrymandering to voter suppression to minority targeted registration purges (see Crosscheck link), to the crowning fraud of the Electoral College. Here in Georgia, as in many states now, Election Fraud takes the form of Zero Evidence Electronic Voting systems where the ballots and counts cannot be verified or audited (see PaperCounts link).
Democracy is a powerful ideal, but until we own that it does not exist in this nation in any recognizable form, and then make it our primary priority to establish democracy as the foundation of our political systems, there will be no social justice or sane governance in the U.S.

Brian Stelter and guests advised reporters need to use the words ""Demagogue"" and ""Authoritarian"" to describe Trump and his tactics are those of a ""Strong Man"" De-legitimatizing the media. 

The media has NOT been legitimate. CNN & its staff know itâ€™s not the FREEDOM of the media that heâ€™s attacking but the SPIN, the reporting of half truths when the media fails to report all material facts pertaining to an event rather than reporting all of the material facts, the taking of comments or events out of context, etc. that Trump is attacking and the media hates the fact heâ€™s the first president or politician to expose the media and its dishonesty. 

That is why Americans who believe in the honesty of the media is so low! The main stream media is guilty of those shortcomings and most knowledgeable Americans recognize those shortcomings. 

I feel such shows to be nothing but left wing propaganda. 
That said, Trump's treatment of those who attend Trump University's courses was TERRIBLE.  There really was no excuse for what happened to them.  I was NOT a Trump fan.  I first supported Carson, then Fironia, then Cruz however, I'm hopeful he's going to succeed and keep his promises.

Now about Bernie. He has great progressive ideas and I liked a lot of what he said. And yes, he would have done much better in the Rust Belt. But the changes he proposed were too much, too fast for the American people as a whole. Things don't change quickly in our country, it's built into the system on purpose. Just look at the extreme division regarding the ACA. With the Democrats having the White House, Senate and House they STILL couldn't get a single-payer program passed. And looking at the exit polling from this election most Trump voters feel that things are changing too fast now and that they are being left behind, and forgotten. That's a lot of what he played on, those exact fears. So I don't think Bernie would have been the best candidate to counter that argument. Don't get me wrong though, I want Bernie to fight for his ideas because I think they will make progress towards making the country better for all those who are fighting and uphill battle. However, I feel that his best chance of actually bringing true change is in the Senate where he does have some power and influence.","1042660372529638_1259790717413295",2016-11-14

Democrats have promised many things over the years and never delivered until Obamacare and that has turned into a financial nightmare, just as predicted by so many on the right. Perhaps that's why it didn't take full effect until after Obama had to face reelection, it was designed to fail and create a demand for single-payer healthcare. Democrats have salivated over that for years, ever wondered why?

Dear readers, here's something else you can do: When your representatives are planning to vote on something, remember that they represent YOU. You have a voice. Use it!

Call your representatives and let them know where you stand. It's surprisingly quick and easy, not contentious, no arguing, none of that. At worst they may ask for some demographic info. Easy peasy. Those staffers are doing a lot of legwork. Be excellent to them.

Fossil fuels made human survival possible w light and heat. Agriculture and domesticated cattle (beef) brought civilization. Cooking helped man to digest foods and provide protein for brain growth. Every modern necessity, convenience, comfort, and health aide uses fossil fuel power.

How do we smelt iron ore or recycle scrap metals to build energy saving devices and buildings without fossil fuels? I never heard of an all electric passenger jet, cargo ship, or Mac truck. Is the airline and shipping industry doomed? NO. Fossil fuel IS an economy. Eliminate fossil fuel use, and I expect much of humanity will die anyway.

Is it really clear that governments will trade an income tax revenue stream for carbon tax revenue stream? What would be the carbon tax on manufacturing wind mills, batteries, electric cars, and photo cells? Equivalently, how many years of continuous operation would be necessary to make up for the carbon released by the manufacture of these devices?

Is it really clear that putting Companies out of business for using cheap palm oil or raising beef will have no further economic or carbon consequences, e g., on employees, consumers or their communities?

Every gov subsidy for green energy has been completely absorbed as profit by green energy companies providing the product. E.G., a high efficiency heat pump cost me three times as much to install as an ordinary heat pump ten years earlier... really? Compressor technology expanded by a factor of 2-3?

Do we really trust our government to pursue policies for the benefit of all of society or only the elitist populations with wealth?
I think, it will be we the consumer who pays for global warming initiatives, and we will endure the economic insults, not producers or industry. Everyone gets to burn fossil fuels but the consumer.

Government has much higher and urgent priorities than this... social injustice, incompetent economic policies, ISIS, and political corruption. You can't take care of the planet unless you take care of yourself first.","1042660372529638_1280689945336670",2016-11-14

There was zero coverage of that so of course everybody on the coasts was surprised by the election.  I know I was.  I didn't vote for Trump, and 99% of the time I think John Oliver is hliarious.  But to say WaPo and NYT had great coverage of Trump is laughable - they completely missed it just like everybody else.  Hence, the election shock.  We should demand more of our media.  But we won't, and that's unfortunate.","1042660372529638_620115208161582",2016-11-14

Is this a case of both comedians having the same joke that Trump is in way over his head (if it is you'd think Oliver's team would've edited his out since he airs a day later) or did HBO have the rights to use the audio for the initial airing but not on HBOGO or the internet?","1042660372529638_1259832977409069",2016-11-14

By offending half of the US that voted trump on your once beloved show that I would watch happily every Sunday, I can honestly say now - I am VERY disappointed with you !!

I am VERY disappointed that you decided to stop going after bureaucracy And government grid locks issues like you did in your previous season.

I am VERY disappointed with you because you decided to be a follower of the main stream media and not be a leader that is different.

I am VERY disappointed with you because you just couldnâ€™t help yourself not mock and laugh AT people that you didnâ€™t agree with.
I am VERY disappointed with you because your humor got condescending like you are with the â€œcoolâ€ kids now and forgot your past.
I am VERY disappointed with you because now I can even look at you because you got me SO upset.
I hope you are doing well and happy with the popular kids now. But donâ€™t forget, like always, they will dump you the minute they will find another â€œsuckerâ€. This time people like me, the UN popular we wonâ€™t forgive and  wonâ€™t forget

Its not Trump whos dividing this country and making us not able to even look at each other in the face anymore, its people like you. People who use buzzwords and labels to shutdown arguments rather than engaging in discussion, people like you who want people to apologize for atrocities they themselves never committed or even thought of committing, and more importantly people like you who think anyone of color of of the opposite gender is somehow a victim that needs to be coddled. There is a reason more minorities and women voted for Trump instead of Romney and that's because Trump didn't treat them as helpless victims. In the end Trump didnt beat the Democrats, The Democrats beat the Democrats by creating  the oppression Olympics, putting forward an out of touch corrupt candidate, and above all courting smug journalist and celebrities instead of middle America. And my god the only good thing to come out of this is not the title of 1st women president has a chance to be held by a women everyone respects rather than one everyone despises.","1042660372529638_620218081484628",2016-11-14

While 2016 has been an awful year, it's also been awful watching a truly brilliant comedian like yourself become so quickly unfunny.  You've shifted to mean-spirited bullying jokes that anyone can deliver versus what we loved you for which was intelligent jokes that made people think.  Time for you to move off of Trump otherwise your viewership is going to take major hit.

Also, to clarify for you, the New York Times nor the Washington Post are symbols of journalistic integrity.  NYT violated the laws in illegally obtaining Trump's tax returns.  Their CEO even publicly stated he would break the law to take down Trump.  That is not integrity.  At the WaPo, the rag is now owned by Jeff Bezos and its singular purpose is to attack government to ensure an internet sales tax is not implemented.  Don't ever breath that these are good organizations.

Al Capone be like ""I extorted, ran gambling rackets, bribed officials and incited violence, but they could only get me on tax evasion. Meanwhile, this Trump guy gets away with doing almost the same things. Surely the FBI and IRS can apply similar due diligence and resources as used against me. I guarantee you, the system is rigged.""","1042660372529638_1075619852536228",2016-11-15

I'm frankly surprised how ,like a domino, you have fallen in line with the populist media without a thorough reflection of what is said as compared to what is truly intended. Obamacare is forced upon the population and for those who choose not to have health care because they have been screwed in the past and are still paying off those bills before obamacare came along are now being penalized through tax refunds for not having what they are told to have concerning health insurance. Obamacare is simply an unconstitutional act. 
Building a wall is ludicrous and won't happen and Trumps statements seem to hold no weight but what of the Mexican drug cartels that burrow like rats (not because of race or country but for lack of morality and moral character) under state lines via tunnels to sell drugs and bring violence across the US border?
Deporting all undocumented immigrants is impractical BUT the logic stands true, if you came into this country illegally you are by definition an illegal immigrant. You have broken the law. You have stepped in front of THOUSANDS of people who are trying to enter this country in the right way according to United States laws as a country. 
In doing so how are you better or more important than any of those thousands of people? 
Hillary Clinton should be investigated. All politics aside, a fair and balanced committee should investigate all of her dealings and that of the Clinton foundation. Whether guilty or not, a full investigation into all of her dealings and actions should take place just as it should for any candidate or person of political office. Resolve question completely. 
Ban all Muslims? Labeling it as a religious ban is unAmerican yet banning any refugees or immigrants from any country which is a threat to our country and or an enemy of the United States is logically speaking a sound foundation. We didn't take thousands of refugees in from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.","1042660372529638_1259869557405411",2016-11-14

"3207","Daylight Saving Time - How Is This Still A Thing?","br0NW9ufUUw","479042895558058_1033612186767790","Hillary. It's a woman. nothing else matters. Meanwhile, in the real world of crony plutocrats and oligarchs.... 

Hillary $ Trump... alarmingly similar. Trump was a democrat for years while Hillary has never been liberal or ""democrat"". They meet in the middle as crony capitalist, moderate republicans with bad judgment.

Both:

~ Share the same 1209 North Orange, Wilmington Delaware address, onshore tax haven for tax avoidance & evasion = offshore accounts bad! (onshore accounts, please keep quiet about all that, OK?!) wwwDOTtheguardianDOTcom/business/2016/apr/25/Delaware-tax-loophole-1209-north-orange-trump-clinton

~ Both bad on immigration. deport, deport, deport. Hillary voted many times to build a wall. www.latintimesDOTcom/hillary-clinton-bragging-about-building-border-wall-keeping-out-illegal-immigrants-35263

~ Bad on environment. Trump denies global warming. Hillary knows it's there but has nothing because she is beholden to fossil fuel lobbyists $$$ = no carbon tax. The DNC platform committee has already rejected carbon tax so that is the direction. Let the good times roll for clinton donors like Hedge fund D.E. Shaw, who paid ""donated"" $1.5 million because he owns $470 million in shares of oil refinery behemoth Marathon Petroleum.

~ War hawks... war first (repercussions later) no judgment or foresight. just quagmire.. ISIS... more new enemies... and never any political solutions/outcomes. See Jill Stein for judgment

~ Pro status quo, 1% oligarchy, plutocracy in tact = no commercial banking, wall street, or tax reform. Dear Hillary: Shadow banking (offshore accounts) doesn't cause recessions or require bailouts here in the USA.

~ Pro BIG government - ""Defense"" spending, social security, medicaid, Medicare = no change (Trump cut much smaller EPA, dept. of Ed.)

~ They are friends (when no one is looking). Hillary went to Trump's wedding as his friend because she ""thought it would be fun""... you know, OUR people! $$$$$$$. Trump said ""Hillary would make a fantastic president"" About that ""judgment"" thing...

~ Trump: better on trade deals (TPP, KAFTA, TTIP, NAFTA). Hillary is really wobbly here... really. See Jill Stein for guidance

Gun control: 

Hillary, gun control but only domestically. Hillary, no gun control outside the U.S (or bombs, missiles, tanks, and jet fighters). While secretary of state, she brokered weapons deals to multiple countries who then contributed money to the Clinton foundation. Not sure how Trump's cabinet will be with military industrial complex sales for private foundation gain?

Racism:

They are both racist, Trump explicitly for all to see, Hillary implicitly via some of her work (lawyer for Walmart for 6 years 86-92', protecting the Walton family wealth at the expense of families and minorities). And ""Black Lives shattered"" refers to the triad of laws by Bill Clinton in the 90's that crushed black communities, laws that were pushed 100% by Hillary. The Clinton's have been apologizing ever since for these failed laws (crime bill, welfare reform bill, and NAFTA). BLM continue to protest the Clinton's.

Hillary Trump = no thanks.... I'm good.

If you are not the 1%, you have no right to vote democrat or republican in 2016. Bubble-gum politics are a corporate distraction. So stop chewing, look at your assets and bank account, vote accordingly.

Women, blacks, immigrants, LGBTQ, veterans, senior citizens, unemployed, without healthcare, shot by guns.... whatever you personally think is SO important......... guess what we all have in common? A need to pay for food and rent! A need to NOT be pilfered, annually.

99% of Americans suffer economic disenfranchisement via our current plutocracy. ALL of us are victims of wealth inequality that the media avoids and neither Trump or Clinton will change in significant ways. And why would they, it's been a great ride the last 40 years!!

Since then, after learning the DNC cheated for her, she committed perjury, lying to congress that she never sent classified emails, hired dws after dws lied, used BleachBit to hide emails then lost and/or smashed evidence with a hammer.... she lost the moral/ethical election months ago and my vote. 

I'm personally ashamed to have unknowingly supported this activity. I will be voting Green party for the general. Not my original plan but electing hillary now sends a message to our children that lying, cheating, and committing crimes are ok as long as you win. We need role models to lead by teaching what is appropriate. She sullies feminism and women worldwide. Women should never be portrayed as too weak to win fairly. Ever. That is neither feminist, progressive, or ""liberal"". But that is the democratic party now... self-inflicting misogynists, solidifying female inferiority. She ""didn't know"" what her duties are, is utterly clueless, projecting female stupidity; that females are unfit to lead. My family is better than this.

If you want to martyr for women, do it for a REAL woman, with morals and values. Jill Stein. Or anyone NOT Hillary Trump. Both are wasted protest votes, same plutocracy for oligarch outcome.

In the past, people who didn't want others to celebrate different cultures were known as racists. Don't pretend like getting angry when a white person wears a sombrero is anything other than your pathetic white guilt expressed in a desperate attempt to hide your own racism. Unfortunate to see it's not just conservatives who hate it when people express different cultures.

Stopping a white person from wearing a sombrero or drinking tequila doesn't make Mexicans feel better, it makes YOU feel better.

Or will we have to resort to never being allowed to dress up as anyone else? Will the same line be drawn between men dressing up like women. Or women dressing up as men? o wait thats different...or is it? There is definitely something off the mark with the exqmples given, the intention of a put downs very poor taste. To erase lines by highlighting them seems counterproductive. It's reminds me of the typical ""whatever you do don't look down"" Which inevitably ends with the person looking down. In this case we are saying don't cross the line but the idea is have no lines. Isn't it?  I'd ask Russell Peters. There is a better way. We keep looking at the same problem from the same angle, we need a different vantage point.","1021314137997595_1022279787901030",2016-10-28

Between the two of you, I would like an episode where EVERYTHING is covered! Throughout, you point out the massive holes in everything he says, even show recordings of when he made the claims you will subtly push onto him. Eventually, this leads to a Frost/Nixon situation, in which the hero stands before the giant grapefruit demon. Four massive security guards--one black, one Chinese, one Mexican, one Muslim, and you introduce them to Drumpf--will stand around the desk, and when you FINALLY cause Drumpf to snap and lunge over the table, attempting to wrap his microbial-sized hands around your neck, the guards grab him, you look at the country, take a stand, and give a speech, as Drumpf is dragged off-stage, revealing to everyone, even the Drumpf supporters who will follow this nutbag into the pits of Hell, just how f*cking psycho he truly is, before apologizing to the rest of us that even this will NEVER change the views of that section of people...

I voted for Hillary in the primary but since then, after learning the DNC cheated for her, she committed perjury, hired dws after dws lied, used BleachBit to try to hide emails then lost and/or smashed evidence she used for classified information with a hammer (13 blackberries and 5 ipads).......

I'm personally ashamed to have unknowingly supported this activity. I will be voting Green party for the general. Not my original plan but electing hillary now sends a message to our children that lying, cheating, and committing crimes are ok as long as you win. We need role models to lead by teaching what is appropriate. She sullies feminism and women worldwide. Women should never be portrayed as too weak to win fairly. Ever. That is neither feminist, progressive, or ""liberal"". But that is the democratic party now... self-inflicting misogynists, solidifying female inferiority. She ""didn't know"" what her duties are, is utterly clueless, projecting female stupidity; that females are unfit to lead. My family is better than this.

If you want to martyr for women, do it for a REAL woman, with morals and values. Jill Stein. Or anyone NOT Hillary Trump. They are wasted protest votes, same plutocracy for oligarch outcome. Neither will change a thing for average Americans and will keep selling out for the current and long standing, corporate coup d'tat.","1004906702971672_1004907602971582",2016-10-10

The Investor's Business Daily/TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence Tracking Poll shows Clinton at 42 percent compared to Trump's 41 percent, figures within the poll's margin of error. 

Among religious groups, 49 percent of protestant voters and 46 of Catholic voters said they favored Trump as opposed to 36 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for Clinton. 

Among those who said they were ""other"" religions, Clinton won 44 percent to 40 percent and those who listed their religious affiliation as ""none"" opted for the Democratic nominee 51 percent to 21 percent.

Always research your supplement company and look for products without excipients (fillers), with 3rd party certification, and avoid products made in china and remember diet is 80%.

2. When you're home by yourself, dial your landline # on your cell phone. Leave farm animal sounds or muppet songs on the answering machine. When your family or roommate comes home, say, ""There's a message for you on the machine, but I'm not sure who it's from.""
3. Write nonsensical notes and leave them around your home or office. They can say anything from ""Watch me whip, watch me nae nae,"" to ""This is a piece of a paper with words written on it,"" to ""Ernie/Bert 2016. Make America Ducky Again."" Let your imagination run wild!
4. When riding public transportation, hold a banana up to your ear and talk on it as though it were a phone. Eat the banana. Then say, ""Where did my phone go? I was just talking on it, and now all I have is this banana peel!"" Frantically go through your purse or briefcase until you find your real cell phone. Pretend to make a call and say, ""Sorry about that, we must have gotten disconnected. It really drives me bananas.""","874765872652423_874788302650180",2016-04-01

Brasil 20.04.16 15:50
Ms. Christiane Amanpour,

Mr. Glenn Greenwald told you that plutocrats are using ""anti-democratic means"" to impeach President Dilma Rousseff.

We must say that Mr. Greewald lied to you because he has connections with Workers' Party supporters.

To be re-elected in 2014, Dilma Rousseff violated our Constitution defrauding the government budget and hiding a 15 billion dollars deficit. Our laws consider this a serious crime (and this is a serious crime in any civilized country). By doing so, she worsened the economic crisis affecting especially the poorest -- economic crisis caused by her continuous fiscal irresponsibility.

But Dilma Rousseff committed other crimes.

It's not true that she was cleared in Petrobras corruption scandal. The latest investigations of Operation Car Wash show that Dilma Rousseff is deeply implicated in it.

She was elected and re-elected with money stolen from Petrobras, the large Brazilian oil company that was destroyed by the corruption schemes of Workers' Party and its political allies. Her campaign money was dirty as revealed by whistleblowers to judge Sergio Moro and federal attorneys of Operation Car Wash.

We would like to remind that thousands of American shareholders of Petrobras lost large amounts of money because of corruption scandal. And Dilma Rousseff, as former head of Petrobras board, faces a huge class action in Manhattan.

Dilma Rousseff also attempted to obstruct justice by appointing Lula, the former president, as a minister. This would place him out of reach of Sergio Moro, the judge leading the Petrobras corruption investigation.

For all these reasons, Dilma Rousseff will be impeached. It is a lie that the process of impeachment is a coup. The Congress proceeds strictly within the Constitution limits as stated by Brazilian Supreme Court. Dilma Rousseff and Workers' Party just try to create a smokescreen over their crimes and fool the international press. Mr. Greenwald is just helping them.

Bernie Sanders absolutely was NOT there. Bernie chained himself ankle-to-ankle with a black woman in the 60's to protest segregation and was arrested for it. Hillary was absolutely not there. 

Bernie: wins hearts by flying coach, among the people (search #SandersOnAPlane). Hillary: flies private corporate sponsored jets, just like Trump

Bernie Sanders: raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Hillary: raise it to $12 an hour. How's $12, single parent with children?

Bernie: credit rating agencies Moody's, S&P, and Fitch will become non-profit so they can't lie with bogus ratings to win over Wall Street clients, like they did in the 07/08 mortgage crisis. Hillary GIVES paid speeches TO wall street and private equity firms for fundraising!!!! $600,000 from Goldman Sachs in one year.

Bernie: universal healthcare for ALL, as a right, not a privilege. Hillary: strengthen Obamacare, which serves some.

Bernie: all public colleges and universities to be tuition-free by paying for it with a tax on wall street speculation. Hillary does not want tuition-free higher ed. but wants ""debt free tuition"" where broke families and teens still need to pay = barrier to entry

Bernie: make for-profit prisons ILLEGAL and abolish private prisons!! Supports demilitarizing police. Hillary accepted $130,000 in donations from prison lobbyists.

Bernie: bust up the biggest banks. Hillary: make it more expensive for banks to be very big.

Bernie: resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that separated commercial from investment banking Hillary doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s necessary to go that far. (Bill Clinton joined Republicans in repealing Glass-Steagall after 70 years of protecting the American people).

Bernie: tax speculative trading on Wall Street. Hillary doesnâ€™t think thatâ€™s necessary either.

Bernie: expand Social Security by raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security payroll tax. Hillary: protect Social Security as is.

Bernie: allow states to legalize marijuana and remove marijuana as a federally classified drug to help those affected most (minorities and ALL taxpayers). Hillary: put marijuana on a lower drug enforcement classification but don't legalize it. (i.e. continue blacks and minorities getting disproportionately imprisoned. Support for-profit prisons. Stifle needed tax revenue from legal sales)

Bernie: start ""postal-banking"" so basic banking services can be accessed by ALL communities, especially those underserved communities who are preyed on by pay-day lenders. Hillary..... well, I'm not sure how she plans on helping minority communities??

Bernie doesn't have and isnâ€™t taking money from corporate PACs or Super PACs. Hillary does and is even while being 'anti-citizens united' (?????)

Bernie: automatic federal investigation for anyone who dies in police apprehension or custody. Hillary: ""these groups (of blacks) are super predators who need to be brought to heel"" (like dogs). Supports crime bill, welfare reform, and NAFTA.... collectively known as ""Black Lives Shattered"" for crack / cocaine sentencing disparity, cutting aid to needy families, and sending labor jobs overseas 

Bernie's top ten donors are unions who represent people and The People. Hillary's top ten donors are banks, corporations, and media representing the 1%.

Bernie can do all these great things for THE PEOPLE because he will take from the 1%. Hillary WILL NOT take from the 1% via strong Wall Street, bank, or tax reforms so all her stances can only be Bernie-lite. She can't pay for what we deserve with her status quo, establishment, corporate backed politics.

Brasil 20.04.16 15:50
Ms. Christiane Amanpour,

Mr. Glenn Greenwald told you that plutocrats are using ""anti-democratic means"" to impeach President Dilma Rousseff.

We must say that Mr. Greewald lied to you because he has connections with Workers' Party supporters.

To be re-elected in 2014, Dilma Rousseff violated our Constitution defrauding the government budget and hiding a 15 billion dollars deficit. Our laws consider this a serious crime (and this is a serious crime in any civilized country). By doing so, she worsened the economic crisis affecting especially the poorest -- economic crisis caused by her continuous fiscal irresponsibility.

But Dilma Rousseff committed other crimes.

It's not true that she was cleared in Petrobras corruption scandal. The latest investigations of Operation Car Wash show that Dilma Rousseff is deeply implicated in it.

She was elected and re-elected with money stolen from Petrobras, the large Brazilian oil company that was destroyed by the corruption schemes of Workers' Party and its political allies. Her campaign money was dirty as revealed by whistleblowers to judge Sergio Moro and federal attorneys of Operation Car Wash.

We would like to remind that thousands of American shareholders of Petrobras lost large amounts of money because of corruption scandal. And Dilma Rousseff, as former head of Petrobras board, faces a huge class action in Manhattan.

Dilma Rousseff also attempted to obstruct justice by appointing Lula, the former president, as a minister. This would place him out of reach of Sergio Moro, the judge leading the Petrobras corruption investigation.

For all these reasons, Dilma Rousseff will be impeached. It is a lie that the process of impeachment is a coup. The Congress proceeds strictly within the Constitution limits as stated by Brazilian Supreme Court. Dilma Rousseff and Workers' Party just try to create a smokescreen over their crimes and fool the international press. Mr. Greenwald is just helping them.

Those of you in the southern latitudes (including NYC) may not care whether the clock shifts one hour one way or the other because there's not that much variation between winter and summer solstice. But for those of us here in the north (i.e. Seattle) daylight savings means the sun doesn't set until after 9pm in the summer, which is awesome, while also preventing the sun from rising after 8am in the winter, which would suck.

I'm fine if states like Florida, Arizona, Texas, etc. want to get rid of daylight savings because they're so far south. But for those of us up here in the north (Washington, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, etc), Daylight Savings is very useful. I'd be a fan of even having the summer solstice be two hours different from the winter solstice, so that the sun never rises later than 7am, while still setting after 9pm in the summer.","792574124204932_792627314199613",2015-10-30

"4931","Daylight Saving Time - How Is This Still A Thing?","br0NW9ufUUw","479042895558058_792574124204932","Simple Answer is that most people live in small countries and or states and  the ""benefit"" of daylight savings appears directly related to your (latitude/proximity to the equator). Rather than your longitude (which typically determines your time zone).

A recent referendum in Western Australia (latitude changing from its southern most of approx 35 degrees south to its northernmost point of approx 15 degrees south) showed that those living in the more southerly parts of the state were much more in favor of DLS that those living closer to the equator/North of the Tropic of Capricorn at 23 degrees south. 

Despite the majority of eligible voters voting in favor of adopting DLS. The motion failed due to the intricacies of the rules covering referendum in Australia. 

As a result the three states/territories of Australia that include all land north of the Tropic of Capricorn not adopting DLS while all of the more southerly states do. 

The net effect being that the failure of the northern states/territories to adopt DLS has created an impediment to those states doing business with the more populous Southern States (where most multinational companies choose to headquarter their Australian operations).","792574124204932_792629850866026",2015-10-30

This reminds me of an argument that came up when a Japanese cosplayer (her name escapes me) dressed up as Garnet from Steven Universe. She went to lengths to no just wear the character's costume, but to look exactly like the character. Garnet is often portrayed as a black woman when it comes to fan art and cosplay so this cosplayer stained her own face, neck, hands, and every visible patch of skin. She was wearing the character so well you couldn't tell the cosplayer underneath was extremely white. But people flipped out. Personally, if you go to the effort to not just wear similar clothes but to actually be the character, I see this as a form of respect. I hate how anything a white person does is an insult. Yes, we were jackasses in the past, but ""blackfacing"" originated as a way to make fun of African Americans. Cosplaying is paying the ultimate respect to not only a character but the creators of said character, so why can't Caucasians (or even paler Asians!) show our respect? There's a difference between paying respect to a character of color and flat out insulting a race. Go ahead and flame me, but I stand by my belief that going to lengths for a white person to look exactly like a colored character for a few hours isn't racist.","791771114285233_792383797557298",2015-10-30

This clip makes it seem (for the most part) as if using any stereotypical characteristic of a country or region is racism. This is not true per se, racism applies when you use those characteristics as a basis for inequality. A sombrero does not in itself imply that mexicans are any less than the rest of the world. If any characteristic description qualifies as being racist, then we can't describy any group of people anymore. But it doesn't, and we can. So long as you're not trying to say one is better than the other because of that characteristic.","791771114285233_792056017590076",2015-10-29

Without his bad math at calculating how far away the East Indies actually were, he never would've stumbled upon this continent, and the world as we know it would be entirely different. So, that's what the holiday is for. 

Also, it's more than a little unfair to impose the morality of the 21st Century upon a culture more than 500 years distant, of which Columbus was only a product. It's not like he was this evil guy, or something. That's just how people thought back then. Hell it's how people thought about other races as little as 50 years ago. Hell, some people still think that other races are inferior to this very day!

So to anyone attempting to judge Columbus by your superior moral standards of today, you need to get off your high horse, realise morality is relative, and Columbus did what literally *anybody else* in his place would do. Do you have to like it? No. But comversely, you don't get to sit in judgement of a man, and an entire society, that is long dead.

Sorry, but people post nonsense on Columbus Day every single year, so I thought I'd just post this today and get it over with.

This group is supposedly a place for everyone to come debate, but at the moment it's just a Trumper cesspool. I think it's a closed group, but I'll add anyone who wants to join - just send me a friend request and I'll add you then add you to the group. You can delete me afterwards, it won't hurt my feelings.

It's a very serious topic about a law that was recently passed in Minnesota about the disposal of fetal tissue. Women can no longer choose to donate aborted fetal/tissue/cells to science or research.

"5928","Back To School (Web Exclusive)","CQ2noSR1qdY","479042895558058_770895519706126","Mr. John Oliver, thank you for all you and your staff does to bring to light many of the brilliant and deplorable things going on the world outside our personal bubbles.  I ask if you could do one more thing with the amazingly entertaining and knowledgable staff on your side.  Hawai'i's public school desperately need help...now.  After years of continually rising temperatures, this record breaking El Nino summer students and staff alike are being subjected to inside classroom and bus temperatures of 90+ degrees with high humidity, pushing the heat index to well above 100 degrees in some cases with little to no relief.  Preschoolers to high school seniors in ninety percent of Hawai'i's 7,000 classrooms do not have air conditioning and many do not even have fans.  Teachers, parents, and private citizens are paying out of pocket to try and bring even a breeze to public schools while education administrators and politicians have air conditioned offices.  Whether this be from mismanagement or the lack of foresight in years past, something needs to be done to alleviate these inhuman conditions.  Children and teachers alike are exhibiting signs of heat exhaustion and possible stroke with headaches, nausea, nose bleeds, flush skin, and dehydration.  Emergency room and doctor visits are actively documenting this.  Please, if there is anything you can do to bring this situation to the public to help these kids, it would be greatly appreciated by oh so many.

The truth is the light, what happened to that evangelist leaders who think the rules dontapply to them Churches are being deceitful conveniantly ignoring the fact their knowingly breakingk laws and of course thats abusing public trust about your tax exempt status which is just unrightous. Which is another reason why most young folks dont go to the hipocritical pick and choose hoity toity organized religious venues as much anymore. As realism rightousness and community trust dies so does our Church communities as they blame every worldly thing possible instead of looking internally or take inventory of their big Churches organizing behaviors as a whole and perge politics from the Church as our founders and Lord Jesus seen fit to do. Remember attraction rather than promotion is the only way to true salvation as today. The fear card is being played among the people of the Churches to fill pews and get folks saved so everyones at ease like its just willy nilly hey Jesus ya gotta minute will ya come into my heart for life so tHe preacher will stop scaring the Jesus out of me before they've truly been attracted to the ideal of ones relationship with Jesus and our Father in heaven ya get my drift. If your a southern Baptist its all about fear which is why Republicans use fear to sway voters accross the South on fox as some still beleive lie Obama is a Muslem and has created death panels and such lies supposed Conservative Christians created on TV to scoop up political voters for them along with thousands of thousands if preachers who've drank the fox news Koch Brothers Trump Republicans billionaire millionaire protectionist kool-aid sold at the expense of their own salvation and the countries health and welfare and governments ability to do rightous work in the world as these fat cat wallstreet billionaire types run away with our government they defunded they rendered not capable of assisting its own sick with affordable single payer healthcare because Republican politicians work for the industry profiteers and they've used propaganda constantly for years as their ideals failed on the merits so they decided like soo many rulers before them have to capitalize on our people of faith especially Christian Churches South and business organizations and their building together political mega-church political churches funded by the 1% millionaire billionaire Rightwing political organizations & individuals politicians lobbyists and others who rely on our called to preach pastors to sell their false narratives through carpetbombing the church conmunity and leaders with literature and using the Lords buildings to raise money unjustly to serve the one percent. Oh! They tell ya its about abortion, guns, and gays high taxes but those are issues that will forever be there. Between individuals and God of their choosingin America, if they choose one hopefully itll be our Lord and savior Jesus Christ & people have since enough to not be apart of such devisive political posturing we the people came to America to get away from. Organized money cannot help themselves from spreading fear, lies, conspiracy, constant outrage and attack soo to keep our eyes off what their really doing, corrupttion Jesus warned of money power infuence & organized profit seeking at the expense of rightous governing of the foolish 1% and they have ruined religious establishment & community with their deperate idealogy that history has shown the 1%serve the larger agendas of cheaper labor low standards of living for America. As their States Rights agenda and ownership society trump the collective will of the peoples and many states fail as a result their plan will be working as these fat cats line up to buy our peoples governing body and resources for pennies on the dollar even more control of every aspect of American life will be in the hands of the Trumps Koch brothers walmart ares.And they know FEAR SELLS! As ontheir fixxed news polotical partisan or onesided soo called news stations commentary the fat cats use the billionaires network to smear and scapegoat the poorest and sickest workers and other they can exploit as their examples of the day to give up on unions government regulation higher axs on the 1% and stopping their offshore tax evasion schemes as they manufacture propaganda to consent from you and me to go get whatever they want out of milking of our cllective American peoples government we elected not to give it away to those who want to drown it in bathtub or poison it legislatively making we the people powerless to fix it after they break it. Voting for a Republican or for a corporacrat is to be against yourselves as the 99% as most are struggling  because of organized money has huge networks of protectoonists mostly paid, and or paying for influence ALL BECAUSE PEOPLE DID NOT CHECK THEIR SOURCES OF INFORMATION NO HAVE THEY BRUSHED UP ON THEIR HISTORY AND CIVIC LESSONS OF THE PAST PEOPLES SUFFERINGS UNDER ORGANIZED $$$","762046093924402_762388477223497",2015-08-24

It is horrible what they have done and it makes Christians look like this to the public, when that is not the truth. These televangelist are not even real Christians, they don't follow Jesus but follow their greed for money. I am glad that my church always says at every service ""we don't want your money"" and you can give only if you want to, you are never forced to give. This is the way it should be, not coerced like these televangelists do. I hope people can see Jesus not as someone looking to grab their money but as a Savior who loves them regardless of whatever wrong they have done, who seeks to have close relationship with people, and who is able to save people from their sins. 

â€œFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.â€

 Welcome, and thank you for being a member of Hillary for America.

 I canâ€™t tell you how much it means to me to know that youâ€™re with us. With your support, weâ€™re going to grow this organization even faster and even smarter -- that means building new tools to communicate with supporters and hiring organizers who will knock on doors and make phone calls to earn each and every Americanâ€™s vote.

Now will you chip in $1 or more to support this work?

 This campaign isnâ€™t about me. Itâ€™s about everyday Americans -- hard workers, problem solvers, and goal-reachers. Americans deserve a raise, and an economy that puts people first.

 You need someone willing to fight for you. I want to be that fighter.

 This team is growing every single day, and Iâ€™m thrilled for each and every American who joins our campaign. Together, we can work toward the America that we believe in -- where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead and stay ahead.

Again, I want to thank you for your support. Taking this campaign all the way -- and defending ourselves against baseless attacks -- is going to mean everyone chipping in what they can, when they can. If youâ€™re with me, will you donate $1 right now and become an official donor to this campaign?

https://www.hillaryclinton.com/donate/

 Youâ€™ll hear from the campaign again soon, so keep an eye out for important updates. And thank you again. Iâ€™m so glad that youâ€™re here.

It is located in the middle of a very poor neighborhood. Every once in a while, they guilt the congregation into giving them more money and they use that whole ""plant your seed"" line to get people to do it. Then they show us what the money is spent on. Usually things for the church like sound equipment, kids stuff, etc. What pisses me off is that a block away is the DSHS office where people are constantly struggling to make ends meet. I just think that if they're going to take so much from the community they need to give back to it. Especially when they're in the middle of a poor one.","762046093924402_762151670580511",2015-08-24

Many CT are truth, deal with it.
1) Goverment planning false terror IN USA (including sinking ships, blowing up planes) - google Operation Northwoods
2) CIA spreading terror in Europe, killing innocent people, even children - google operation Gladio  (great document about it - youtube ""nato secret armies operation gladio"")
3) CIA killing 40 thousand civilians.. sorry, I mean spies... in Vietnam - google Phoenix program vietnam.
4) And finally 9/11 - let me just give you few quotes by US high officials investigating 9/11:
(EXCERPTS from Marshall, Philip book ""The Big Bamboozle: 9/11 and the War on Terror"":)
(...)After submitting an 800-page report to the American public, moderate U.S. Senator Bob Graham of Florida, the co-chairman of the 9/11 Inquiry, said, â€œThere was a â€˜direct lineâ€™ between the terrorists and the government of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government had provided logistical and financial support to at least two of the 9/11 hijackers while they lived in Southern California.â€ [1] One might think a statement of this magnitude would draw significant media attention. It didnâ€™t. For some odd reason, the American media wasnâ€™t interested in the Saudi government being behind the 9/11 attack.(...) Graham published his own book in 2004 entitled Intelligence Matters, where he described a top-heavy coverup by the Intelligence Community. Senator Graham did not mince words, writing that â€œthe Bush White House was determined to cover up Saudi involvement in 9/11 â€“ and that the administration had found an eager accomplice in the FBI.â€
ONE MORE EXCERPT: (...) Later, we see similar officials come forward including the 9/11 Commissionâ€™s own General Counselor John Farmer, who also wrote and published a book in 2008 entitled The Ground Truth. Farmer wrote, â€œWhat government and military officials told Congress, the 9/11 Commission [on which he served], the media, and the public, was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue.â€ Additionally, we see that the two co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, the top two, also had more allegations of conflicts of interests and wrote yet another book entitled Without Precedent. They made an astonishing allegation: â€œThe 9/11 Commission was designed to fail.â€ [3] So, for those of us keeping score, there have been two official federal investigations into the September 11th attack and three out of four of the co-chairmen have written and published books to tell us that something is seriously wrong with the Bush Administrationâ€™s version of events. The more we focus on 9/11, the more we see that anyone who has truly investigated it has tried to speak up. But like Graham and Farmer, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, Steve Pieczenikâ€™s interview was simply ignored by the commercial, corporate media. In todayâ€™s America, if any revelation is not reported in the six top media conglomerates, it simply never happened (...)

Its not that these people and shows aren't funhy or entertaining as they often times are, but I think they have a way of lulling people with a sense of narrative that basically even though things might be really messed up, and a lot needs to be fixed, they're still basically 'ok' we are still a basically 'good' and 'decent' country and don't really expose the reality that our ""good' country and its political system has been totally captured in a slow-motion silent coup that is in its most advanced stages... they utterly fail to bring people's attention to this emergency, and given the amount of influence these men do have, that is a damaging and destructive failure on their part and they are actually assisting the forces behind the coup in doing their work.","739445499517795_747192392076439",2015-07-23

How crazy would the U.S. be if Muslim's did this in Chicago? Fix the Racism, Poverty and general lack of caring about each other! You American's are better than this and probably smarter? Just Google Americans Shot or Murdered on July 4th, 2015, compared to any other 1st World Country! Wake Up! Lotsa Love to the Families affected this weekend and every other weeked by Gun Violence!
Bloody weekend in Chicago centers around gangs, guns
Gun violence marred the July 4th holiday in Chicago, as police and gang members traded bullets across the city. In total, 82 people were shot and 14 were killed over the weekend. Dean Reynolds reports.

Subject of Fireworks: the are an ahhh, for those who have never seen them. Municipal, Commercial displays are awesome @ their expensive, how ever for the viewer is is all about sight & sound!
For those, I'm included in the do it yourselfers who paid out big bucks for the bang & managed to survive without injury or damage....good on you!
At my age, my advise is save your money, watch the aerial displays @ some one else's expense.
This way your free of liability, injury & expense.
May everyone have a safe & sane 4 of July!

What greater success do/can you have in life other than understanding the (valid) definition of ""Love?""
Simple logic shows that â€œLoveâ€ is always firstly dependent on ""choice"" as â€œHopeâ€ because although you may choose to â€œLoveâ€ another (person or thing), there is no valid way of guaranteeing that â€œLoveâ€ will be returned/reciprocal; therefore it is a â€œblindtrustâ€/â€Hope.â€ (""Selfless"") ""Love"" forms a circle because one individual always benefits/puts the other first (doing for others), but does your ""heart"" agree?
Selflessly,
Ps. 'Eternal Optimism... approach of understanding any human's ""intent"" can easily be seen through their ""Heart's Desire."" ""Trust"" requires the dual combination of ""respect"" and ""communication,"" but without one or only giving partiality to either action, then one doesn't truly ""trust"" or believe in doing the action for its â€œtruth in purpose.â€ Instead, the individual will ""deceive"" others by making their intent to seem as ""charitable concern"" for the â€œpretendedâ€ well-being of others. The ultimate climb/war that is fought anywhere on earth can always be reduced to ""Love"" (selfless) vs ""Greed"" (selfish).

The segment presents the issue as though the two options are Pay Athletes and Don't Pay Athletes; no mention whatsoever of alternatives like minor league systems, intramural leagues, European model sports academies; no problem at all with the many, many, many special treatments athletes *do* get (inflated test scores, excused absences, endless exceptions to rules non-athlete students are held to, not to mention being registered, yes, for joke classes like Swahili which for some reason here is presented as an injustice); in short, no suggestion whatsoever that athletics have now completely distracted from University's purpose, which is an academic institution. Paying the athletes would only further  distance their status as students who are playing sports as an extracurricular activity and more or less just completely make them employees. Disagree with that point if you want, but LWT's not even attempting to address any of that is a weird oversight.","672344419561237_672356509560028",2015-03-19

So should the person rowing at bunker hill community college get paid as well as the star player on Kentucky? I hate to agree with the douchebag chairman of the NCAA but these kids do get an education from a good university. Even if they don't learn anything besides ""Swahili"", they at least get the degree so they can enter the workforce with a chance.

Universities are nonprofit institutions, and they are institutions of academia--the whole enterprise of extracurricular sports shouldn't be a business. If any money is made, it should go back into the school, which helps the athletes' education, since their academic institution is then supported. The only reason athletes are overworked is because we've made it a business, and we demand more of their time because there's money to be made. You don't solve that by making it even more into a business by making them employees. You get rid of youth athletics being an industry altogether. And again, maybe that's debatable, but my point is that that's the kind of point LWT has become famous for making (locating the problem in the institution, not some symptom of it), and they totally miss that opportunity here.","672344419561237_672384052890607",2015-03-19

Which means, smaller colleges will be forced to shutter their athletic programs as they won't be able to afford to pay their players. Is that fair to a student who has a full ride for hockey at a Division II school, and carries a 4.0 GPA in engineering (they don't offer Swahili at his school)? If they cave, the NCAA will, in essence, be responsible for ultimately dismantling college athletics as we've known it for the past century or so.
I don't have a solution, but, how about a salary cap on coaches (from both university and additional revenue streams), revenue sharing across all athletic divisions (See: MLB), and eventually create some financial parity among university faculty, scholarship, and funding for non-athletic programs?
Normally, I love LWT as a terrific outlet for REAL news, but, there is SOOO much more to this story than this segment presented.","672344419561237_672369262892086",2015-03-19

"7114","The NCAA","pX8BXH3SJn0","479042895558058_672344419561237","I agree w/ this segment on some points, especially players getting paid for their likeness, or jerseys being sold. I think they completely glossed over how much value there is in getting a scholarship, especially since an undergraduate can easily be $60k. I know a lot of families that wish they could afford college, and a lot of sports scholarships allow them the opportunity. Not every single school is like UNC, where they're handed diplomas for playing sports. Plus, who's going to pay all the atheletes? Like he said in the segment, a lot of schools are losing money because of their sports programs, not all are Alabama. So let's say the starting QB gets paid, then how much does the wrestler at Montana St get paid? Who decides this? The NCAA? Schools? Then students at Montana St will need to start paying more in student fees? One person can't get paid a set amount, and not expect it to open up a whole world of litigation, which will just result in even higher tuition for everyone else. I get the basic idea, a group of people are making a lot of money on a group of people that don't get ""anything""....except for a $60k scholarship. I agree fully on getting rid of the NCAA, but there's a lot of layers to this than just pay the students.","672344419561237_672431062885906",2015-03-19

Universities are our leaders in drug research, military research, air/space research, medical research and pull in millions for an institution but the student receives zero even if they are lead researcher for the project.  They have rigorous schedules all year, many early morning and late night hours at the lab, weekends at clinics, and run community outreach with no time for social life (there is no off season for them), all while accepting being yelled at by their lab director as typical treatment.  They are not paid, scholarships usually don't include housing or food, there is no star status nor perks like  the athletes receive on campus.  They too must perform to a high level or their scholarship disappears.  Few lucrative careers exist for them and of those:  i.e., M.D. - only 1 in 3 applicants are even accepted into med school which itself can cost a quarter of a million dollars to attend.  Yet we only seem concerned for student athletes.  I see little difference between the experience for the academic scholar student and the student athlete.  However, I continue to believe that paying any student for performing the tasks for which they receive their scholarship is not appropriate.  Scholarships are competitive and require fierce determination and hard work, and should remain the only compensation from the university to the student.","672344419561237_673995906062755",2015-03-21

I detest it! it makes getting up early dark and getting off work dark. How can anyone stand living in darkness? I don't know how those people near the north pole tolerate it. (Course 30 days of night - the movie, lets us know what could happen with all that darkness. Gives Vampires their major opportunity..don't think you have to believe in something for it to exist. Denial is not going to change anything.) Be happy in your DST. I can't go 50 miles without the time being fast. Just wish they'd leave it alone one way or the other. Like John Oliver says..How's thils a thing? It came out of WWI. Any of you remember fighting in that war? Why is there still a law on the books? Like, why can't American Samoans, Puerto Ricans, etc. vote? If , indeed, they are American citizens why does a 100+ law keep them from being true Americans?

There are FOUR UN member states have never joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty: India, Pakistan and South Sudan. If our weapons tech seems outdated, you might be imagining what it's like there. 

The 4th country that's never joined the NPT is sitting on that powder keg we call the Middle East and it's name is not Iran. Seems like nobody is concerned that Israel won't join. People seem to be okay with the idea that Israeli nuclear weapons program being ""secret"" is... what? A special case, because the Holocaust justifies any measure Israel takes to ensure its survival? 

The Holocaust happened. No denying that. The Jews were the largest group targeted by the Nazis... but by no means, the only group. Also, killed were  millions of Ukrainians and Slavic peoples, Gypsies, Russians, those with learning disabilities, people with mental disorders, the deaf, the physically disabled, homosexuals, anyone with conflicting political views, even Jehovah's Witnesses and anyone else the Nazis considered ""subhuman"". 

Before anyone gets bent out of shape and accuses me of anti-Semitism -- because people have been, but not by any Jews  -- I don't give two shits for one religion over another because they're all bunk to me. And I also do not believe that the majority of Jews anywhere  *play* the Holocaust like a card. But I do think the govt of Israel, specifically Netanyahu, does.... That ""card"" has become a tool for strategy, negotiation,social political and financial support. 

Aside from whether having nuclear weapons is, on it's face, right or wrong, anywhere or time -- doesn't every country that has nuclear weapons have them to insure it's survival? And if the Holocaust justifies Israel's non-participation in the NPT then why, in the eyes of our ""Great Democratic Nation,"" isn't the Holocaust justification for all groups killed in it to have secret nuclear weapons too? Surely, the peoples' of those other groups are not less deserving, less human, than Jews in Israel. 

With all the money we give to Israel, their nuclear program better be more update than ours. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing that, unless Israel ""feels"" like telling us.","543846169077730_543912202404460",2014-07-28

Oder Tag des Kampfes gegen die Verbreitung von Kernwaffen?
===
Heute, der 6 August ist der Tag, an dem die USA eine Atombombe geworfen und hunderttausende Menschenleben ohne jegliche Notwendigkeit vernichtet haben. Nur weil sie die eigene Macht demonstrieren wollten und die Verbrennung der hunderttausenden Menschen wurde fÃ¼r sie ein gÃ¼nstiger AnlaÃŸ zur Machtdemonstration.
Aber sie sind nicht stehengeblieben und haben ihr schreckliches Verbrechen nach kaum 3 Tagen wiederholt und eine weitere Bombe jetzt auf Nagasaki geworfen.
Warum hat die Menschheit bis jetzt nicht gewagt dieses blutige Verbrechen von USA zu verurteilen?
Was ist mit dem menschlichen Verstand und Gewissen auf ganzer Welt geschehen?
Denn genau dieses Schweigen hat dazu gebracht, dass der wahnsinnig gewordene und blutgieriege Verbrecher seinen aggressiven Vormarsch auf die Zivilisation fortgefÃ¼hrt hat.
#Faschington hat nach Hiroshima und Nagasaki dutzende Male andere LÃ¤nder angegriffen, die Tausende Kilometer weit von ihm entfernt sind, hat dort das blutige Chaos und Schrecken gesÃ¤t, die MenschenschicksÃ¤le zerstÃ¶rt, und die Chancen der Menschen auf das GlÃ¼ck und ruhiges Leben ruiniert.
Vietnam, Korea, Grenada, Kuba, Nikaragua, Panama, Irak, Afghanistan , Jugoslawien, Lybien, Syrien, Ukraineâ€¦
Hatte die brutale Vernichtung der Bewohner von Hiroshima und Nagasaki nicht das Ziel, dass danach die ganze Welt aus Angst dem #Faschington nicht widerzusprechen wagt?
Was bekommen wir im Ergebnis.?
An der Grenze des neuen Jahrtausends benimmt sich die â€œzivilisierte Weltâ€ wie eine Gemeinschaft der elenden Feiglinge, die einem verbrecherischen Staatsapparat erlauben aufrichtige Greueltaten zu verrichten, und alle zu vernichten, die versuchen sich nicht zu unterordnen.
Ist nicht die Zeit gekommen dieser entehrenden Etappe des Menschheitsleben ein Ende zu setzen?
Ist nicht die Zeit gekommen anzukÃ¼ndigen, dass heute ist der TAG DER OPFER DER VERBRECHEN DER USA, #FASCHINGTON?
Ist nicht die Zeit gekommen ein neues internationale Tribunal zusammenzurufen, fÃ¼r die Untersuchung aller blutigen sinnlosen Verbrechen der USA und sie Ã¶ffentlich zu verurteilen?
Wenn das nicht geschieht, wird unsere Zivilisation den Sinn ihrer Existenz verlieren. Unter dem Druck der dummen, vor Gier und Herrschsucht wahnsinnig gewordener amerikanischen Elite wird die Menschheit auf ihre alle wichtigen Werte verzichten, wie HerzensgÃ¼te, MitgefÃ¼hl, Streben nach Gerechtigkeit, NÃ¤chstenliebe, Streben nach Wahrheit, Streben nach der Freiheit von den Vorurteilen und TÃ¤uschungen, Werte, die stÃ¶ren die besten Eigenschaften des Menschen an den Tag zu legen!
Wenn die vernÃ¼nftige und tapfere Menschen die USA, #Faschington nicht zwingen werden auf ihre Ambitionen die ganze Welt zu erobern und zu versklaven, zu verzichten, dann wird diese Versklavung sehr bald geschehen.
Die modernen Waffenarten, die modernen Kontrollmittel erlauben ganz gut das zu erreichen.
Genau deswegen, ausgerechnet jetzt, wo die USA mehr als 700 MilitÃ¤rbasen haben und daher keine Angst ihre Meinung Ã¼berall aufzuzwingen, beliebige Verbrechen vollzubringen, jeden beliebigen anzuklagen, ohne irgendwelche Beweise, ohne Scham und Angst vor der mÃ¶glichen Bestrafung wegen der LÃ¼ge und das vergossene Blut der Millionen Menschen.
Genau deswegen kann die USA der ganzen Welt ankÃ¼ndigen, dass sie die GefÃ¤ngnisse fÃ¼r Folter schaffen, um den beliebigen Menschen aus belibiegem Land zu klauen und ohne Gericht und Ermittlung zu foltern.
Genau deswegen kÃ¶nnen die USA sich leisten die unschuldige Menschen zu tÃ¶ten mit Dronen und wieder ohne Gericht und Ermittlung.
Weil die ganze Welt feige schweigt und denkt â€“ â€œwir werden davon nicht betroffen sein, wir haben uns gut verstecktâ€.
Das ist schrecklich unwÃ¼rdiges Benehmen fÃ¼r die Menschheit. Und dem soll ein Ende gesetzt werden. Es ist genug sich selbst zu betrÃ¼gen und zu sagen: â€œwir werden davon nicht betroffen seinâ€
Das ist schrecklich dumm!!!
Das wird alle betreffen.
Ohne Ausnahme.
Stumpfsinnige und aus Gier, Eitel und Hass wahnsinnig gewordene US â€“ Elite zweifellos wird sich anstrengen jeden zu versklaven oder zu vernichten, frÃ¼her oder spÃ¤ter. Wenn sie nicht persÃ¶nlich sie gelangen wird, dann zu euren Kindern und Enkeln. Es ist keine andere MÃ¶glichkeit Ã¼brig geblieben.
Wenn ihr euch auch weiter so benehmt, sich feige versteckt und sich selber betrÃ¼gt, die Augen schlieÃŸt und die Stimme eigenes Gewissens nicht anhÃ¶rt!
Deswegen, Freunde, sagt mir aufrichtig, ist es nicht die Zeit, den 6. August als Tag der Errinerung der Opfer der Verbrechen von USA, #Faschington anzukÃ¼ndigen?
WAS WIRD UNS STÃ–REN DAS ZU TUN?
Waren nicht genÃ¼gend blutige Verbrechen mit HÃ¤nden dieser gewissenlosen Schurken verÃ¼bt?
Haben sie nicht genug Drohungen fÃ¼r unsere allgemeinmenschliche Zukunft gestiftet?","543846169077730_549002125228801",2014-08-07

"8245","Wealth Gap","LfgSEwjAeno","479042895558058_536993916429622","Awesome segment, but I think he was giving the US a bit too much credit saying that the basic reason for the rise in income inequality in the US is the extreme optimism of the American people. It might have something to do with it, but when he asked how is it that in a system that is governed by the majority, they keep supporting policies that benefit the very few at the expense of the very many, I was sure he'd be taking it in a different direction.
Not too long ago, after all, he himself mentioned how the Supreme Court decided that spending money is a form of free speech. In other words - America has turned from a place where each person has a voice, into a country where each dollar has a voice.
And once you realize that, the answer becomes patently clear - if money equals speech, then clearly those with more money have more access to speech. They can then use this extra power to ensure more laws benefiting them are passed, thus perpetuating the cycle and increasing inequality.
This also means that fixing the problem is slightly easier than making American culture more pessimistic and beaten down. To fix the problem, America needs to go back to a system of one person, one vote: put a strict cap on political donations, overturn Citizens United, and stop treating corporations as people (if corporations are people, they should pay income taxes, not corporate taxes). They can keep the optimism. That's part's pretty cool.","536993916429622_537758226353191",2014-07-16

Owners of corporations, or stockholders, should not have to pay for abortions if they believe that it is murder. That's one side. The other is that women employees should have access to insurance that will cover all their medical needs. Both are pretty important issues.","530497350412612_530738480388499",2014-07-02

That's right: Our groundbreaking PSA was kept off the air this July 4th because Exxon, the richest company in the history of the world, couldn't be subjected to 30 seconds of on-air criticism.

This is disgraceful - and if we fold this time, the Big Media corporations will do it again, and again, and again, until they've silenced all of us. 

That's why we're asking you to take action now, to tell them: NO. Just NO. You can't silence the truth about Exxon.

This is the beginning, not the end of this story - there are still avenues left to get this ad on the air, or simply seen by as many Americans as possible. We're going to keep fighting.

Because if they think this will stop us, well...they don't know you. But we do.

I'm keeping this short because I know it's a holiday. Thank you for all you do to make this movement real, every single day.

The Obama administration provided exemptions to religious non-profits, hospitals, and churches years ago, allowing insurance companies to offer birth control services direct to employees, bypassing those religious-affiliated groups while not fining them every day for not providing minimal essential coverages to their employees.  Then he turned around and declared that businesses would get no exceptions because there was no way to accommodate providing birth control services to employees without employer groups providing the care and/or being fined for not doing so...right after his administration accommodated a whole bunch of other similarly-minded groups in a much less restrictive fashion.  

That is what the case hinged on - the Obama administration couldn't pretend that demanding that businesses pay for birth control services was the least restrictive course of action to provide those services when they already chose to exempt other groups and provide alternatives to get those services that were significantly less onerous.  By doing that alone, the administration violated the law.  From the opinion: 

""As we explained above, HHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections. Under that accommodation, the organization can self-certify that it opposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services. If the organization makes such a certification, the organizationâ€™s insurance issuer or third-party administrator must â€œ[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health planâ€ and â€œ[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be coveredâ€ without imposing â€œany cost-sharing requirements â€¦ on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.â€

So the administration already set up the work around to the law they were trying to enforce on Hobby Lobby, undercutting themselves.","530497350412612_530522063743474",2014-07-01

Not to mention the revolving door in employment between FDA employees and the pharmaceutical industry. The public should use caution and self education regarding both supplements and prescribed medications and not just put trust in their health care provider or take the word of a TV entertainer who happens to also be a doctor.","526230880839259_526833157445698",2014-06-24

Most of what you are saying is just as mis-leading as what Dr Oz has said.  Example: Tryptophan did not cause any deaths. One contaminated batch from one Japanese supplier caused illness. But the FDA banned Tryptophan because it was competing with the pharmaceutical industry. When Tryptophan was banned, sales for Prosac and sleeping pills increased dramatically because people were no longer able to get Tryptophan. I must also mention that when the FDA banned Tryptophan, they made an exception for baby formula. Drug companies could still buy or produce Tryptphan and put it in infant formulas. I mean, after  all, baby formula is not competition for anti-depressants and sleeping pills. Oh and by the way, the same year that the patent ran out for Prosac, the Tryptophan ban was lifted.

And then there was the show where he exposed the 16+ pesticides, insecticides and antibiotics that cover non organic produce.

Even if he does recommend supplements he also shows alternative ways to solve that health related problem. Really as far as the ethical practices related to the manufacturing process the sole blame goes to the company who makes the product not Dr. Oz himself also you need to take in account the experts that come onto the show who promote the product. 

Though on a another point when Dr.Oz does promote these products it would be nice and helpful if he would mention any studies and trials conducted on those supplements and products and the results that came about.","526230880839259_526642380798109",2014-06-24

The tissue on the route will be starved in the short run.  There will be a sort of dumping off of 'riches' to the desks of a few CEOs.
In the long run, however, the health of the whole is negatively impacted.  Killing the host is a bad business model.

Another analogy might be giving brick and mortar shop owners the right to lasso pedestrians, haul them into their stores 
to facilitate the liberation of cash from the wallets of said pedestrians in payment for the privilege of walking past their store. I really see no difference.

There really is no justification for this other than a more complex edition of exploitation.  Manifest destiny 2.5.  something like,
 ""I killed the driver and took the reins therefore God loves me more and any argument constitutes a crime"".  The right of human people 
(hereinafter referred to as citizens/non-incorporated) to access information is becoming a naive belief in fairy tales. 

There must be limits and oversights on the use of power in this world regardless of the form that power takes.","522952884500392_524101761052171",2014-06-19

Im an Aussie not bitter about 2022 just angered it was never ever an even playing field when we ""competed"" against Qatar.

Ive been to Doha for Socceroos workd cup qualifiers in June it was 35 degrees at 8pm kick off? 

The middle east should get a world cup but just bid saying the event is hosted in January. 

However the lies and how Qatar used its ""resources"" its a joke.

Will Sony and the other sponsors have enough sway to change this will they pull their money from FIFA? Can they afford to lose that coverage.

ECFS Filing Receipt - Confirmation number: 201465061951
CommentAre you crazy? Or just plain short on sight? How is it that you cannot see any degree of meaningful disparity or conflict of interest by restricting the American public accessibility to high speed, reliable and open Net Neutrality? From what information I have seen, there is nothing good to come out of this pro-telecom shecanery as explained by the FCC Chairman, a former lobbyist, for the very same telecoms that stand to benefit from this new policy. The idea of Net Neutrality is one right that every informed American should have provided to them as the needs of the American public have in keeping up with news in a timely way; in staying entertained in a more modern way--as technology provides as well as in keeping up with what many other countries in the world have currently. The Internet is an important mode of communication, being equal to the telephone or television, and almost as important as receiving mail from the Post Office.. because it is one of the primary ways that we get our daily informational access from. You have not convinced me through any degree of solid reasoning to purposely slow down the speed of the flow of information as to how it will benefit Americans. I can surmise though.. it will be for the notion of GREED... of the telecoms and other providers of the more monopolistic firms. So Mr. Chairman, why is there no competition in certain parts of the country between telecoms? Why is that? Mr. Chairman, you are compromised. You are the wolf in sheepskin and you are looking no further than to help your telecom buddies that you were formerly lobbying for. Why should this policy you advocate be any different? Mr. Chairman you should recuse your role in this hearing of Net Neutrality because you cannot be trusted to be an impartial party. I thought the FCC was supposed to be an advocate for the people first, because you are supposed to have OUR interests in mind... I am deeply sorry, but I fail to see your point or reasoning of just how a vote against Net Neutrality is going to help an average citizen like me.Disclaimer

I've been working full time in the eCommerce industry for about 4 years now and I love it.  Thanks to net neutrality and a level playing field, the American citizen can again think of owning and operating their own small business, the best way to build our middle class and economy.  This has been all but taken from us in the brick & mortar setting for so many other traditional businesses in the United States.  If you allow this two tier system then you allow more monopolization of our economy, putting another chunk of the wealth of our nation into the hands of a very few, and not allowing for competition in the marketplace.  This is not in the best interests of our nation's economic health or its citizenry; only a boon to an already obscenely wealthy and much < 1% of its population.

The American dream is that anyone with good ideas that is willing to work hard can overcome adversity and be successful. Sadly, the current reality in America is that without start-up capital it is virtually impossible to succeed. The rich get richer while the poor get poorer. The one large exception to this sad state of affairs is the internet. Where an opinion or product or service or movie/video from a person in small town America can compete on an even playing field with a large corporation. On the internet content is king... and ideas can compete on a relatively even playing field. The proposed changes will ruin this.

If the people of the United States of America are to be a part of the politics witch run THEIR country you must give then a place to start, and thoes places are dissapering. This is why we need the net, yes most of us only use I for Mems and Facebook but leave it for thoes of us who want to take action. Let us be a country of OPPURTUNITY, not OPRESSION, and one that is made up of people not corperations that can pay the exorbitant fees to get ideas out there. Ohh and power corrups absolutly, right?

Make another comment ... and tell the FCC AGAIN to STOP attacking Net Neutrality and reclassify the Internet as a PUBLIC UTILITY! Please share this! --- http://www.fcc.gov/Comments 

Yes, the FCC is CLAIMING that the barage of internet comments which crashed it's site after the John Oliver rant against their plan to END Net neutrality was actually a Denial of Service attack

The FCC is claiming that even though it got more than 80,000 individual comments, that they were invalid. They say the 'attack' was ""a database DoS attack, where the hacker targets the underlying infrastructure of the website itself, rather than just bombarding the site with traffic. In the FCCâ€™s case, 'the intruders' repeatedly initiated new public commentsâ€”most likely using an automated scriptâ€”and then almost instantaneously executed searches for those records.""

 ... and it looks like the FCC is planning on WRITING OFF those 80,000 comments that it got which were against their plan for ending Net Neutrality!  

So it is time for all 80,000+ people to resubmit their comments!

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is to be abolished. The promise of a ""Million Solar Roofs"" is broken. And in what can only be described as an ideological move, the Abbott government introduced bills to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, despite it making a profit last year. The Prime Minister has declared war on the Australian renewable energy industry, the environment and science itself.  The overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming is based on evidence, whether Tony Abbott chooses to act on it or not. A sceptic is someone who doubts accepted opinion; a denier is someone who refuses to accept fact. Scepticism is healthy, denial is dangerous, and intentionally dismantling the entire renewable energy industry of a country that is not only wealthy, sun blessed and windswept but also has the highest per capita CO2 emissions in the OECD is criminally reckless. Furthermore, it will cripple our future economic growth.  The global economy has embraced the renewable energy industry. Last year wind power grew by 25 per cent worldwide and solar power by 30 per cent. On May 11, Germany met 74 per cent of its electricity demand with renewable energy.  Germany, the strongest and largest economy in Europe, has only half the average solar resource of Australia yet has 10 times the capacity of solar PV panels. The Chinese economy is four times the size of ours yet they have 30 times as much wind power installed.","514745085321172_514839558645058",2014-06-02

But, no one can ask the victim how terribly they suffered, no one cares, if you are the victim our society must think you are weak, worthless, and obviously desire what happened to you or there would be many more death penalty convictions and executions. If we go back a few hundred years the response was simpler, a crime involving death or rape was a blood honor crime requiring the family and friends to take care of the person who committed the act. For the person who was tortured, murdered and terrorized by a killer the only fair response is the life of the criminal.","500865503375797_501124950016519",2014-05-06

Two losers went on a home invasion spree, killed and assaulted the wife and two daughters, nearly killed the father, then burned them to death. They confessed, and both offered to plead guilty if they didn't get the death penalty. The state refused, and three years later, they were found guilty and sentenced to death. Well, it was politically popular, but the appeals will drag on for years. Both monsters were victims of repeated molestation from family members, which is the case for a high percentage of these murderers. I don't know, but the defense said, hey, you could have had life in prison three weeks after the crime, and these jerks would have living in tiny cells for the rest of their lives.
